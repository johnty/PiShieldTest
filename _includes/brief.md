The I-CubeX RPi module is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi devices that adds analog input and support for 5V I2C sensors. It is designed to match the exact dimensions of the Pi Zero, but also works with all other models. It adds 8 channels of analog input for connecting with I-CubeX or any 3-pin analog sensor that operates on 5V, as well as I-CubeX and other I2C devices.
