![image of shield]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/shield_angle.jpg =250x)

*There are various options available*: 

- A complete, ready to run package that includes the addon module, a Pi board, adapters, as well a sensor starter pack. A pre-configured SD card image is also included so all you have to do is plug and play!

- The addon board with a pre-configured SD card image so you can start trying out the examples straight away. For those who already have a Pi device and wants to use sensors. Don't forget to grab a couple of sensors[link](/to/product/page), if you don't have some already!

- The addon board by itself. For those who are comfortable setting up the software by themselves. We have included instructions here [link](/to/product/page), as well as a pre-configured SD card image [link](/to/product/page). This image can also be used to restore the system to its original setting and you don't want to manually reconfigure everything again!

- Just the SD card (with the pre-configured image)
